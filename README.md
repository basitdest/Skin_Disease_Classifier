# Skin_Disease_Classifier
This Model is built using Google Colaboratory in the beginning to benefit the Virtual GPU and optimize development of the model. 
We have used several layers in the model which provide Block-wise approach to detect and classify skin diseases. 
This contains several layers such as MaxPooling2D, Conv2D, Dense, Dropout, Flatten, and Batch Normalization.
We have used two datasets and combined them after cleaning, annotating, and preprocessing of the dataset to obtain better results.
The first dataset is DermNet, which required cleaning, and annotating the dataset.
The second dataset is ISIC 2019, which also required to be cleaned and annotating.
This model works on FIVE types of Skin Disease Detection
Using analysis we have chosen the most common types of skin diseases in the region.
This model took us almost an year to be built with multiple collaborators in order to acheive a validation accuracy of 90%.
This model was tested on InceptionV3 and VDD based models which did not perform any better, infact it performed worse.
This has a custom CNN based model which has Block-wise approach through layers to detect and identify skin disease from an image.

The steps required for anyone to run this model can be acheived by downloading the dataset and the model files.
Which soon will be updated by time in order for everyone to use it.
